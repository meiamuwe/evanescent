== How to compile the solver? ==

-- General requirements: 
 
	* Compiler: DMD compiler v1.041 (or later)
 	* D-Runtime: TANGO Runtime Library v0.99.9

-- WINDOWS
	* Make sure that you have the built tool "jake" on your system 
	  (comes with the Tango+DMD bundle)
	* Open a command-line and change to the directory "evanescent\deescover"
	  containing the folders "src\", "tes\", etc. 
	* Adapt the pathes used in file "make-release.bat" to match the D installation 
	  on your system
	* enter "make-release.bat"
	* find the executable in bin\

-- LINUX / UNIX
	* Make sure that you have the built tool "rebuild" on your system 
	* Open a command-line and change to the directory "evanescent\deescover"
	  containing the folders "src\", "tes\", etc. 
	* execute "make-release.sh"
	* find the executable in bin\

== Usage: command-line interface ==

To call test solver on a SAT problem using the command-line interface, the
problem must be represented as a plain ASCII file following the DIMACS specification.

Simply use the following command to invoke the solver: 
 
deescover_release [options] -in=<input-file> 

  where input must be in plain DIMACS.

The following options can be used on demand to change the search process of the solver: 

   -polarity-mode = {true,false,rnd}
   -decay         = <num> [ 0 - 1 ]
   -rnd-freq      = <num> [ 0 - 1 ]
   -verbosity     = {0,1} ; 0 = SILENT, 1 = SOME PROGRESS INFORMATION

The options mean the following: 

 	* polarity-mode: 	specifies which literal for a variable v selected at a branching point shall
				be considered first. "true" means the positive literal for v, "false" means the
				negative literal for v. "rnd" causes the solver to select randomly between the
				positive and the negative literal in each branching point. 

	* decay: 		rate with which variable activity is periodically decrease during the solution process.
	
	*  rnd-freq: 		rate of randomly selected variables to branch on during the solution process.

	* verbosity: 		sets the detail of information the solver outputs during a solution process.  
				0 = SILENT, 1 = SOME PROGRESS INFORMATION
